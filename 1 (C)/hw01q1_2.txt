/----------------------------------------------Compiling----------------------------------------------------------/

   Before we address the differences in compilation between GCC and Visual Studio we need to define what compilation
is. Compilation is essentially when a high level language, in this case C, is taken and broken down to assembly/
machine code so the computer can actually understand what human is trying to tell it. When using GCC we used a
primitive compile method by navigating through the directory via console, editing the code though the pico text
 editor/command "pico <filename.c>, find errors through the "gcc -Wall Filename.c -o <binname>" command,
 and once satisfied you would execute your result by "./<filename>" command. You would continuously repeat these
steps until the code compiled gave the desired result. Visual Studio on the other hand had a much more autonomous
feel. Everything seemed to be more modern and self-completing. A prime example of how syntactical errors would be
noticed in real time without having to compile. This is a much more efficient approach, instead of having to compile
and search through command code to find errors, it is highlighted/underlined to point it out beforehand. Lastly,
the most impressive and useful feature of VS is the way you compile and debug. With a simple shortcut of "ctrl + f5"
both commands were executed simultaneously. In terms of modernity and efficiency VS shows its superiority in
compilation.

/------------------------------------------------Editing----------------------------------------------------------/

   Before we address the differences in editing between GCC and Visual Studio we need to define what editing is.
Editing in relation to code is having some type of text editor program that is designed specifically for editing
code by programmers. In GCC if you wanted to reach the actual code you would have to enter the command "pico
 <filename.c>". It was really inconvenient not having a separate window for the build output and the actual code
like in Visual Studio. Though it was quite inconvenient it did not compare to how you actually navigated the code.
In GCC you could only navigate through keys instead of clicking, which means if you want to go to the bottom of the
code you would need to hold the down key until you cycled through the entire code. Next if you wanted to select
a section to delete or change you couldn’t. An example of this included when you wanted to delete multiple lines of
code you would have to hold the delete button instead of selecting a section and deleting it like in Visual Studio.
Finally, Visual Studio had a real time syntactical error detector as GCC did not. This made life much easier by
editing the code before actually compiling it to see the mistakes. All in all, Visual Studio was much more enjoyable
to use as you could navigate the code much easier, delete multiple sections of code at once and see the syntactical
errors in real time making the development process much quicker.

/---------------------------------------------Debugging----------------------------------------------------------/

   Before we address the differences in debugging we need to understand exactly what it is. Debugging is essentially
resolving defects that prevent correct operation of code. Some of the most common forms of debugging is semantical
where code is defective in the sense of outputting what was actually intended. In GCC debugging was extremely
primitive in the sense of console use. First you would have to compile the c file into an output executable called
binname. Then, you would have to execute the code through the "./<binname>" command. Once executed only then you 
could see where your mistakes are through the vintage like console window with carrots pointing to some error. The
error descriptions were very vague and most of the time hardly helped. With Visual Studio the error was clearly 
stated in the output window with a very intuitive approach to the error. Most of the time the error description
in VS was descriptive enough to make you have an "Ah-Ha" moment. The only way to get a more accurate approach in 
gcc is to execute the "-g flag" to run debugging, "gbd fileName" command so you could start the actual debugger,
and "break <line_number> to add breakpoint in gcc. Only then can you have a debugging experience that somewhat comes
close to VS's debugging one. Not having the real time syntactical corrections and a menu window really does not come
close to VS in the end.  

/---------------------------------------------Executing----------------------------------------------------------/

   When comparing how the code executes in VS and gcc we see that both environments do the same thing in principle
but in actuality the feel and the approach are both very different. In gcc the commands were long and tedious while
VS's was anything but. For example to execute your code in gcc you would have to do the command "./<fileName>" and
"gcc <filename>.c -o<binname>" to compile the file. Once these commands are in the code will execute and give you
the output. In VS it is much more simple and quick, with just the command of "CTRL f5" you compile and execute at
the same time saving you time and frustration. The output window would the show the program in its entirety. All 
in all as we have seen time after time Visual Studio is much more modern, simple, and efficient in terms of compiling,
editing, debugging, and execution.
